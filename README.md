## Standard Deviation of Sample Tool

## About
Recently I went back to college and I've been taking a Statistics class and something I've been reading on is Standard Deviation. 

Calculating the Standard Deviation of a Sample is more involved than I thought but now that I got it figured out, I figured it would be fun to creating an app that does the work for you. 

Just plug in some numbers and BOOM! You got your Standard Deviation!

## Updates

Update 10/25/2025
Doing some standard clean up in code. Renaming some variables and methods for better clarification. Added a new method: "sample_variance". Moved it out of the 'standard_deviation' method and created a separate method to calculate the variance of a data set. Also renamed the 'standard_deviation' method to 'sample_standard_deviation' future-proof it in case I wanna add any calculations for a population set.

Red Green Refactor done. This app will generate the Sample Standard Deviation. Now to add edge cases. I do plan on being able to drop numbers into the terminal and run the program there.

Finish the 'standard_deviation' method. It's very bloated but soon I'll do red, green, refactor to split up a lot of stuff going on.
