## Standard Deviation of Sample Tool

## About
Recently I went back to college and I've been taking a Statistics class and something I've been reading on is Standard Deviation. 

Calculating the Standard Deviation of a Sample is more involved than I thought but now that I got it figured out, I figured it would be fun to creating an app that does the work for you. 

Just plug in some numbers and BOOM! You got your Standard Deviation!
