## Standard Deviation of Sample Tool

## About
Recently I went back to college and I've been taking a Statistics class and something I've been reading on is Standard Deviation. 

Calculating the Standard Deviation of a Sample is more involved than I thought but now that I got it figured out, I figured it would be fun to creating an app that does the work for you. 

Just plug in some numbers and BOOM! You got your Standard Deviation!

Red Green Refactor done. This app will generate the Sample Standard Deviation. Now to add edge cases. I do plan on being able to drop numbers into the terminal and run the program there.

Finish the 'standard_deviation' method. It's very bloated but soon I'll do red, green, refactor to split up a lot of stuff going on.
