## Standard Deviation of Sample Tool

## About
Recently I went back to college and I've been taking a Statistics class and something I've been reading on is Standard Deviation. 

Calculating the Standard Deviation of a Sample is more involved than I thought but now that I got it figured out, I figured it would be fun to creating an app that does the work for you. 

Just plug in some numbers and BOOM! You got your Standard Deviation!

Finish the 'standard_deviation' method. It's very bloated but soon I'll do red, green, refactor to split up a lot of stuff going on.
